"""Reclaim verified source originals -- preserve-mode only (beets copy / reflink / hardlink).

After `beet import` COPIED matched albums into clean and `verify` confirmed each track by AcoustID
fingerprint, a SOURCE album whose every track has a positively-verified ("ok") clean copy is redundant:
the whole source folder is moved to $MUSIC_DUMP (never deleted). PER-ALBUM only -- a folder is reclaimed
solely when ALL its audio is accounted for in clean AND every matched track verified ok, so a
partially-matched or any-track-unverified album stays intact in source for curation.

clean<->source correlation reuses sidecars' proven DURATION-MULTISET match (robust to tag/name rewrites),
kept strictly BIJECTIVE: a source leaf folder is reclaimed only when it matches exactly ONE clean album
AND that clean album is matched by exactly ONE source folder. So two duplicate source folders (legitimate
in copy mode -- dedup is off) that both match the single imported clean copy are BOTH kept (we cannot tell
which one was copied). A folder with any unreadable track (ffprobe failure -> unmeasurable) is skipped, never
guessed. Multi-disc / nested / ambiguous folders likewise stay in source.

Verdicts come from the verify pass (BEETSDIR/gbc-verify-verdicts.json), written fresh each run so stale data
can never trigger a reclaim. verify is watermark-scoped, so reclaim only acts on albums verified THIS run;
older albums kept earlier are revisited with `gbc run --all` (logged as "unverified-this-run").
