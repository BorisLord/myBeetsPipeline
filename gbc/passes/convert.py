"""Optional pass -- normalise problematic formats in the CLEAN library (on-demand, not in run/inbox):

  WMA       -> AAC/m4a (~256k)   lossy, legacy/proprietary ASF: poor players, weak tags, scrub crash
  WAV+AIFF  -> FLAC (lossless)   uncompressed PCM: ~no tags, huge -> FLAC keeps quality, adds tags, halves size

Rule of thumb applied: lossless source -> FLAC (zero loss); lossy WMA -> AAC (one generational loss for
compat). Each original is MOVED to a quarantine subdir (keep_new) -- NEVER deleted. The NAS source is
read-only and untouched; only files that actually made it into the clean lib are converted.
