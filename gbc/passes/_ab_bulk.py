"""Bulk-apply AcousticBrainz fields to the beets library in ONE process (vs one `beet modify` per recording,
the acousticbrainz pass's real cost). Run by the BEETS venv's python (gbc's venv can't `import beets`):

    <beets-python> _ab_bulk.py <library.db> <fields.json>      fields.json = {mb_trackid: {field: value}, ...}

Mirrors `beet modify`: db store (incl. flex attrs) + native tags (bpm/initial_key) to the file. Prints the
count updated. Imports only beets + stdlib (never gbc -- different venv).
