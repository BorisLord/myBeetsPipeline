"""Pass -- enrich imported tracks with AcousticBrainz acoustic metadata (BPM, key, moods, danceability...).

AcousticBrainz stopped accepting submissions in 2022, but its database is FROZEN, not gone: the read API
still serves every recording it ever analysed, keyed by MusicBrainz recording id. Since gbc only keeps
strongly MB-matched albums, the `mb_trackid` beets assigns is exactly AB's key -> coverage is high (the
whole sample library returned 100%). So this is a cheap network-only enrichment, no local DSP needed
(that would be `beets-xtractor` + an Essentia build -- far heavier, for a gain that only matters on
non-MusicBrainz tracks gbc doesn't keep anyway).

We DON'T use beets' built-in `acousticbrainz` plugin: it is deprecated (logs "This plugin is deprecated
since AcousticBrainz has shut down") and could vanish from a future beets. Instead we hit the same public
API ourselves and write a CURATED SUBSET of its canonical field names (ABSCHEME below -- only the useful
ones: moods, danceability, voice/instrumental, key). `bpm` and `initial_key` are real media fields ->
written into the file tags (a Subsonic/Navidrome player sees them); the moods/danceability classifiers
are non-standard -> stored as beets flexible attributes (db + sidecars; typed via the `types` plugin so
`mood_relaxed:0.9..` ranges work), queryable but not shown by players.

Frozen source => verdicts are cached forever per recording id (BEETSDIR/gbc-acousticbrainz-cache.json):
a recording present in AB is fetched once; one confirmed absent (404 / omitted) is never re-queried; a
network hiccup is left uncached -> retried next run. Best-effort: never gates the pipeline, never moves
or deletes a file.
