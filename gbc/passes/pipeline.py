"""The pipeline: import -> upgrade -> albumdedup -> convert -> verify -> acousticbrainz -> qa.
`run` + `inbox` (cron) both call it; the cron door skips the costly upgrade full-source scan
(`upgrade_scan=False`). Ordering is load-bearing: upgrade right after import (it acts on copies this import
dup-skipped), albumdedup before the expensive passes (they skip quarantined albums), convert BEFORE verify so
every later pass runs identically on the converted files.
