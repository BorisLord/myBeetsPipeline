"""The pipeline: import -> upgrade -> albumdedup -> convert -> verify -> acousticbrainz -> qa.
`run` + `inbox` (cron) both call it; the trigger differs and the cron door skips the costly upgrade
full-source scan (`upgrade_scan=False`). Ordering is load-bearing: upgrade right after
import (it acts on copies this import dup-skipped) and before albumdedup; albumdedup needs only import metadata
so later expensive passes skip quarantined albums; convert BEFORE verify so every later pass runs identically
on the converted (WMA->Opus, WAV/AIFF->FLAC) files.
